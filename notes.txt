Can modify the number of data entries an edge can take (RouterDb.cs l 59)
By default each edge holds 1 data item.
To update that data item use the Edge in the Geometric Graph of the RouterDB routerDb.Network.GeometricGraph.Graph.UpdateEdgeData(1, new uint[2] { 12,13 });
The data persists between all kinds of Edges for a certain edge.

For live routing there are 2 options:
- compute occupancy of the graph at a certain momment when computing the full route
- try computing next decision live for each participant (miht be heavier but should work better)
Discuss (and study) the effect of both approaches
